This project features a landing page containing three different recipes, each recipe features a link to 
a seperate web page showing a brief description of the dish itself, the ingredients associated with 
making the dish alongside the steps involved in cooking the dish. 
The skills demonstrated while making this project include referencing other web pages as 
hyperlinks, displaying  and referencing images, working with different html tags such as lists and 
heading together with using git commands to track and upload my work.
